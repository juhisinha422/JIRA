JIRA is a project management tool by Atlassian used mainly by software teams to track tasks, bugs, and projects.

SCRUM :- Scrum is a framework for managing software development; it divides work into small parts.

SPRINT :- Sprint is a time-based period in Scrum during which a specific set of work is completed and made ready for review.

In JIRA, there are three main points when we are creating a Scrum:

Epic -> Story -> Task.

1️⃣ Epic :- An epic is a big task or feature that is too large to complete in one shot; that’s why it is broken down into smaller tasks like ( story , tasks ) is called an epic.


2️⃣ Story :- A story means why we are completing this goal.

3️⃣ Task :- A task is a small piece of work that needs to be done. It usually focuses on technical or development work.
