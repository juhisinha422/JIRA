🔹 Jira Basics
Understanding the core features of Jira — creating projects, navigating the dashboard, understanding boards (Scrum/Kanban), and using filters or views to manage work.

🔹 Story, Epic, Task
These are key issue types in Jira:
Epic: A large body of work that can be broken down into smaller tasks.
Story: A user requirement or feature — part of an epic.
Task: A unit of work assigned to a team member.
 This hierarchy helps in tracking and organizing work clearly.

🔹 Jira + Slack Integration
Connecting Jira with Slack to get instant updates, comments, and issue tracking directly in your Slack channels — making team collaboration smoother.

🔹 Jira + GitHub Integration
Linking Jira with GitHub so that commits, pull requests, and branches are automatically linked to Jira issues — great for syncing development work with project tracking.

All of this makes tracking and managing projects a breeze! 💼⚙️
